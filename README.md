This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  When an object is deallocated while observers are still registered for its properties, unexpected behavior or crashes can occur.  The `bug.m` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version that avoids this issue.  The solution emphasizes the importance of removing observers in the `- (void)dealloc` method or by using appropriate block-based KVO techniques to prevent dangling pointers and ensure safe memory management.
